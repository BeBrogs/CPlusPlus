The contents of the directories are as follows:

- UNIQUE_POINTERS:
	- Showcase of Unique Pointers, the multiple ways we can establish and initialize these, as well as 
	  implementing a collection of Unique Pointers using vectors and the move operator.
	- The ability to access member methods of a unique pointer vector pointing to a custom class using 
	  a for loop.
	- Also use of the .reset() method to nullify unique pointers.
	- Use of the .get() to retrieve the address of our unique pointer. 


- SHARED_POINTERS (4):
        - Showcase of Shared Pointers, the multiple ways we can establish and initialize these, as well as
          implementing a collection of Shared Pointers using vectors.
        - The ability to access member methods of a smart pointer vector pointing to a custom class using 
          a for loop.


- SHARED_AND_UNIQUE_POINTERS (2/showcase.cpp):
	- Showcase of Unique Pointers and Shared Pointers, as well as some explination
	- Essentially a mix of both descriptions of UNIQUE_POINTERS & SHARED_POINTERS


- WEAK_POINTERS (2/showcase.cpp):
	- Light showcase of assigning a weak pointer to a previously established shared pointer


- CUSTOM DELETERS:
	- Showcase of Custom Deleters to act upon shared pointers


- SHOWCASE:
	- Showcase of all of the above
	-Also a further implementation of OOP, especially Inheritance and Polymorphism w/ the use of Interface
	 classes and pure virtual functions
